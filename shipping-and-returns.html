      <h2>How to Order</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Browse Our Listings:</strong> Explore our website to
        discover a variety of products available for purchase. We now offer
        both in-stock items and special order products sourced from trusted
        Japanese marketplaces and retail stores.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Place an Order:</strong> If an item is labeled "In Stock,"
        it is available for immediate shipping. Products marked "Special
        Order" will be purchased after you complete payment. If you’re using
        our proxy-buying service, we will source the item specifically for
        you. Please read more about how our proxy-buying service works.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Deposit & Confirmation:</strong> For special order and
        proxy-buying items, we require a deposit to proceed with your
        request. This allows us to secure the item on your behalf. If the
        item is no longer available, we will notify you and issue a refund.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>We Source & Purchase:</strong> Our team will locate the
        product in Japan from online marketplaces like Mercari, Yahoo
        Auctions, or retail stores. Once secured, we inspect the item and
        prepare it for shipment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Shipping & Delivery:</strong> For in-stock items, we ship
        immediately using reliable international carriers. Special order and
        proxy-buying items will be shipped as soon as we receive them.
        Tracking details will be provided so you can monitor your package’s
        journey from Japan to your doorstep.

          We thoroughly inspect all items before they are shipped to ensure they
          are in the best possible condition. If your item arrives damaged, you
          must file a claim directly with the delivery service. We are not
          responsible for damages that occur during shipping. If your package is
          lost, please contact the carrier to initiate a claim.
        </p>

        <h2>Shipping Delays</h2>
        <p>
          We are not responsible for any shipping delays once the item has been
          shipped. Any inquiries regarding delays should be directed to the
          carrier service handling your shipment.
        </p>

        <h2>Tracking Information</h2>
        <p>
          All items will be shipped with a tracking number. Customers will
          receive tracking details once the order has been shipped, allowing
          them to monitor the delivery status.
