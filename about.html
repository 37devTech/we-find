          <p>
            <strong>Place an Order:</strong> If an item is labeled "In Stock,"
            it is available for immediate shipping. Products marked "Special
            Order" will be purchased after you complete payment. If you’re using
            our proxy-buying service, we will source the item specifically for
            you. Please read more about how our proxy-buying service works.

          <p>
            <strong>Deposit & Confirmation:</strong> For special order and
            proxy-buying items, we require a deposit to proceed with your
            request. This allows us to secure the item on your behalf. If the
            item is no longer available, we will notify you and issue a refund.

            <strong>We Source & Purchase:</strong> Our team will locate the
            product in Japan from online marketplaces like Mercari, Yahoo
            Auctions, or retail stores. Once secured, we inspect the item and
            prepare it for shipment.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Shipping & Delivery:</strong> For in-stock items, we ship
